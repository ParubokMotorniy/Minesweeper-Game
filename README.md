# Minesweeper-Game
My own Java Swing implementation of the famous Minesweeper game.

This particular implementation stands out thanks to such features:
  - In-game timer
  - Possibility to save the results of each successful run to memory and review them at later times.
  - Possibility to configure the size of the grid and the number of mines before each run.
